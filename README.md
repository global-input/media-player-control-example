This is the source code of [a demo application](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/video-player), demonstrating how you can use the [Global Input App library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to achieve [Second-screen](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/second-screen-experience) feature on a React.js application. The communication between the mobile and your application is secured using end-to-end encryption.
