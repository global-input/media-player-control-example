This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then, the global-input-app extension dependency is added:

```
npm i @bit/globalinput.web.global-input-connect
```
Then the [src/App.js](https://github.com/global-input/media-player-control-example/blob/master/src/App.js) is modified to implement the video player logic and the mobile logic for controlling the video player

 git push --set-upstream origin master

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
