This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then, the global-input-app extension dependency is added:

```
npm i @bit/globalinput.web.global-input-connect
```

Then some generic UI dependencies are added. You can replace them with your preferred JavaScript libraries:

```
npm i @bit/globalinput.web.text-button

```


Finally, the generated ```App.js``` is modified to implement the video player logic and the mobile logic for controlling the video player. The [src/App.js](https://github.com/global-input/media-player-control-example/blob/master/src/App.js) contains all the logic.

You can see that you can browser the programme synopsis on your mobile and then play on any of them on the big screen.



You can run the application using ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start``` command:<br>
```
npm run start
```

And then scan the QR code displayed with your [Global Input App](https://globalinput.co.uk/) on your mobile.
